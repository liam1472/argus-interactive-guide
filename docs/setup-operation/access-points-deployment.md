# Access Points: Deployment

The Access points create a dynamic mesh network which will autoconfigure on setup. 

Repeater AP/s are intended for situations to create a safe location for the trainer at a significant distance from the vehicle operational area (200m +) or around a corner.

### Mounting Information

<div class="card-content">

Repeater APs have magnetic feet that also function as mounting hooks for attachment to mesh surfaces.

#### Mounting Options

- **Bolt plates**: Secure to metal bolt plates
- **Mesh attachment**: Hook directly onto welded metal mesh

#### Positioning Requirements

- **Height**: Place at a height equal to or higher than the Machine AP
- **Line of sight**: Position in clear view of other APs — avoid wall depressions or drive depressions that would obstruct line of sight
- **Placement**: When required, position the Repeater AP at the midpoint of the operational area to extend network coverage as needed

### Access Point: Antenna Orientation

<div class="card-content">

Access point antennas may be configured to either provide maximum range down a straight tunnel run or to provide signals around tunnel corners:

## Level set up for training

To plan training with the VTS, the map diagram below shows an example of a level setup where: 

- **Trainer position** situated out of the way of travel of the loader and other vehicles
- **Trainer AP and Repeater AP locations** shown positioned down a long run and around a corner

Significant operational range can be achieved by following the setup instructions in this guide
